# Full Nodes: 
These nodes maintain a complete copy of the blockchain ledger and validate transactions independently. They contribute to the security and decentralization of the network.

# Light Nodes (SPV Nodes): 
Light nodes do not store the entire blockchain but rely on full nodes to provide them with transaction information for verification. They are lighter in resource requirements and are often used in mobile or resource-constrained devices.

# Mining Nodes: 
Mining nodes are responsible for creating new blocks in the blockchain. They compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to add new blocks to the chain.

# Staking Nodes:
Staking nodes participate in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. They validate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

# Masternodes: 
Masternodes perform specific functions in a blockchain network, such as instant or private transactions, and require a certain amount of cryptocurrency to be held as collateral.

# Economic Nodes: 
Economic nodes are nodes that participate in the economic activities of the blockchain network, such as voting on governance proposals or providing liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

# Boot Nodes (Bootstrap Nodes): 
Boot nodes, also known as bootstrap nodes, are special nodes in a peer-to-peer network that help new nodes join the network. They maintain a list of active nodes and provide this list to new nodes for connection establishment.

# Archive Nodes: 
Archive nodes store all historical states of the blockchain, including every transaction and resulting state change from the beginning. They are useful for applications requiring access to historical data.
