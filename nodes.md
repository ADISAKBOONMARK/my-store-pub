# Nodes

In the context of blockchain technology, a node is a device or computer that participates in the blockchain network. Nodes play a crucial role in maintaining the decentralized nature of blockchain networks by storing a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.

## Full Nodes:

These nodes maintain a complete copy of the blockchain ledger and validate transactions independently. They contribute to the security and decentralization of the network.

## Validator Nodes:

A validator node is a type of node in a blockchain network that participates in the consensus process by validating transactions and creating new blocks. Validator nodes play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain.

## Light Nodes (SPV Nodes):

Light nodes do not store the entire blockchain but rely on full nodes to provide them with transaction information for verification. They are lighter in resource requirements and are often used in mobile or resource-constrained devices.

## Archive Nodes:

Archive nodes store all historical states of the blockchain, including every transaction and resulting state change from the beginning. They are useful for applications requiring access to historical data.

## Boot Nodes (Bootstrap Nodes):

Boot nodes, also known as bootstrap nodes, are special nodes in a peer-to-peer network that help new nodes join the network. They maintain a list of active nodes and provide this list to new nodes for connection establishment.

## Master Nodes:

Masternodes perform specific functions in a blockchain network, such as instant or private transactions, and require a certain amount of cryptocurrency to be held as collateral.

## Economic Nodes:

Economic nodes are nodes that participate in the economic activities of the blockchain network, such as voting on governance proposals or providing liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
